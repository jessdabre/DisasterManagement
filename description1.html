        <p><a href="https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system/public/wireless-emergency-alerts">Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs) </a>are short emergency messages from authorized federal, state, local, tribal and territorial public alerting authorities that can be broadcast from cell towers to any WEA‚Äêenabled mobile device in a locally targeted area. WEAs can be sent by state and local public safety officials, the National Weather Service, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the President of the United States.</p>
            <li >WEAs look like text messages but are designed to get your attention with a unique sound and vibration repeated twice.</li>
            <li>WEAs are no more than 360 characters and include the type and time of the alert, any action you should take and the agency issuing the alert.</li>
            <li>WEAs are not affected by network congestion and will not disrupt texts, calls or data sessions that are in progress.</li>
            <li>You are not charged for receiving WEAs and there is no need to subscribe.</li>
            <h2>Emergency Alert System (EAS)</h2>
