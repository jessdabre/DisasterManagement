        <p class="description">
                
            <b>Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs)</b><br>
            Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs) are short emergency messages from authorized federal, state, local, tribal and territorial public alerting authorities that can be broadcast from cell towers to any WEA‐enabled mobile device in a locally targeted area. WEAs can be sent by state and local public safety officials, the National Weather Service, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the President of the United States.
            WEAs look like text messages but are designed to get your attention with a unique sound and vibration repeated .<br>
        As are no more than 360 characters and include the type and time of the alert, any action you should take and the agency issuing the alert.<br>
        WEAs are not affected by network congestion and will not disrupt texts, calls or data sessions that are in progress.<br>
        You are not charged for receiving WEAs and there is no need to subscribe. <br>
            <b>Emergency Alert System (EAS)</b><br>
            The  Emergency Alert System (EAS)  is a national public warning system that allows the president to address the nation within 10 minutes during a national emergency. State and local authorities may also use the system to deliver important emergency information such as weather information, imminent threats, AMBER alerts and local incident information targeted to specific areas.

        <a class="toggle-link" href="#">Floods</a>
        
        <p class="description"><b>Floods</b>
            <b>Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods are the most common disaster in the United States. Failing to evacuate flooded areas or entering flood waters can lead to injury or death.</b>
            
            Floods may:<br>
            - Result from rain, snow, coastal storms, storm surges, and overflows of dams and other water systems.<br>
            - Develop slowly or quickly. Flash floods can come with no warning.<br>
            - Cause outages, disrupt transportation, damage buildings, and create landslides.<br>
            
            <b>If you are under a flood warning:</b><br>
            - Find safe shelter right away.<br>
            - Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around, Don't Drown!<br>
            - Remember, just six inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away.<br>
            - Stay off bridges over fast-moving water.<br>
            - Evacuate if told to do so.<br>
            - Move to higher ground or a higher floor.<br>
            
            <b>Preparing for a Flood</b><br>
            <b>Purchase Flood Insurance</b><br>
            - Purchase or renew a flood insurance policy. Homeowner’s insurance policies do not cover flooding. It typically takes up to 30 days for a policy to go into effect, so the time to buy is well before a disaster. Get flood coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).<br>
            
            <b>Preparing for a Flood</b><br>
            - Make a plan for your household, including your pets, so that you and your family know what to do, where to go, and what you will need to protect yourselves from flooding. Learn and practice evacuation routes, shelter plans, and flash flood response. Gather supplies, including non-perishable foods, cleaning supplies, and water for several days, in case you must leave immediately or if services are cut off in your area.<br>
            
            <b>In Case of Emergency</b><br>
            - Keep important documents in a waterproof container. Create password-protected digital copies. Protect your property. Move valuables to higher levels. Declutter drains and gutters. Install check valves. Consider a sump pump with a battery.<br>
            
            <b>Staying Safe During a Flood</b><br>
            - Evacuate immediately if told to evacuate. Never drive around barricades. Local responders use them to safely direct traffic out of flooded areas.<br>
            - Stay off bridges over fast-moving water. Fast-moving water can wash bridges away without warning.<br>
            - Stay inside your car if it is trapped in rapidly moving water. Get on the roof if water is rising inside the car.<br>
            - Get to the highest level if trapped in a building. Only get on the roof if necessary and once there signal for help. Do not climb into a closed attic to avoid getting trapped by rising floodwater.<br>
            
            <b>Staying Safe After a Flood</b><br>
            - Pay attention to authorities for information and instructions. Return home only when authorities say it is safe.<br>
            - Wear heavy work gloves, protective clothing, and boots during clean up and use appropriate face coverings or masks if cleaning mold or other debris.<br>
            - People with asthma and other lung conditions and/or immune suppression should not enter buildings with indoor water leaks or mold growth that can be seen or smelled. Children should not take part in disaster cleanup work.<br>
            - Be aware that snakes and other animals may be in your house.<br>
            - Be aware of the risk of electrocution. Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water. Turn off the electricity to prevent electric shock if it is safe to do so.<br>
            - Avoid wading in floodwater, which can be contaminated and contain dangerous debris. Underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water.<br>
            - Use a generator or other gasoline-powered machinery ONLY outdoors and away from windows.<br>

        <a class="toggle-link" href="#">Earthquake </a>
        <p class="description"><b>An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the ground caused by the shifting of rocks deep underneath the earth’s surface. Earthquakes can cause fires, tsunamis, landslides or avalanches. While they can happen anywhere without warning, areas at higher risk for earthquakes include Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Washington and the entire Mississippi River Valley.</b>
            <img src="Images/3.jpg" height="700px" width="700px">
            <b>Prepare Before an Earthquake</b><br>
            <b>The best time to prepare for any disaster is before it happens.</b><br>
            - Practice Drop, Cover, and Hold On with family and coworkers.<br>
            - <b>Make an Emergency Plan:</b> Create a family emergency communications plan that has an out-of-state contact. Plan where to meet if you get separated. Make a supply kit that includes enough food and water for several days, a flashlight, a fire extinguisher, and a whistle.<br>
            - Being prepared allows you to avoid unnecessary excursions and to address minor medical issues at home, alleviating the burden on urgent care centers and hospitals.<br>
            - Remember that not everyone can afford to respond by stocking up on necessities. For those who can afford it, make essential purchases and slowly build up supplies.<br>
            - <b>Protect Your Home:</b> Secure heavy items in your home like bookcases, refrigerators, water heaters, televisions, and objects that hang on walls. Store heavy and breakable objects on low shelves.<br>
            - Consider making improvements to your building to fix structural issues that could cause your building to collapse during an earthquake.<br>
            - Consider obtaining an earthquake insurance policy. A standard homeowner’s insurance policy does not cover earthquake damage.<br>
            
            <b>Stay Safe During</b><br>
            <b><b>If an earthquake happens, protect yourself right away:</b></b><br>
            - If you are in a car, pull over and stop. Set your parking brake.<br>
            - If you are in bed, turn face down and cover your head and neck with a pillow.<br>
            - If you are outdoors, stay outdoors away from buildings.<br>
            - If you are inside, stay and do not run outside and avoid doorways.<br>
            
            <b>Protect Yourself During Earthquakes</b><br>
            <b>1. Drop (or Lock)</b><br>
            - Wherever you are, drop down to your hands and knees and hold onto something sturdy. If you’re using a wheelchair or walker with a seat, make sure your wheels are locked and remain seated until the shaking stops.<br>
            <b>2. Cover</b><br>
            - Cover your head and neck with your arms. If a sturdy table or desk is nearby, crawl underneath it for shelter. If no shelter is nearby, crawl next to an interior wall (away from windows). Crawl only if you can reach better cover without going through an area with more debris. Stay on your knees or bent over to protect vital organs.<br>
            <b>3. Hold On</b><br>
            - If you are under a table or desk, hold on with one hand and be ready to move with it if it moves. If seated and unable to drop to the floor, bend forward, cover your head with your arms, and hold on to your neck with both hands.<br>
            
            <b>Stay Safe After</b><br>
            <b><b>There can be serious hazards after an earthquake, such as damage to the building, leaking gas and water lines, or downed power lines.</b></b><br>
            - Expect aftershocks to follow the main shock of an earthquake. Be ready to Drop, Cover, and Hold On if you feel an aftershock.<br>
            - If you are in a damaged building, go outside and quickly move away from the building. Do not enter damaged buildings.<br>
            - <b>If you are trapped, send a text or bang on a pipe or wall.</b> Cover your mouth with your shirt for protection, and instead of shouting, use a whistle.<br>
            - If you are in an area that may experience tsunamis, go inland or to higher ground immediately after the shaking stops. Avoid contact with floodwaters as they can contain chemicals, sewage, and debris.<br>
            - <b>Once you are safe, pay attention to local news reports for emergency information and instructions via battery-operated radio, TV, social media, or from cell phone text alerts.</b><br>
            - Register on the American Red Cross “Safe and Well” website so people will know you are okay.<br>
            - Use text messages to communicate, which may be more reliable than phone calls.<br>
            - Be careful when cleaning up. Wear protective clothing, including a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, work gloves, and sturdy thick-soled shoes. Do not try to remove heavy debris by yourself. Use an appropriate mask if cleaning mold or other debris. People with asthma and other lung conditions and/or immune suppression should not enter buildings with indoor water leaks or mold growth that can be seen or smelled. Children should not take part in disaster cleanup work.<br>

        <a class="toggle-link" href="#">Make a Plan</a>
        <p class="description">Make a plan today. Your family may not be together if a disaster strikes, so it is important to know which types of disasters could affect your area. Know how you’ll contact one another and reconnect if separated. Establish a family meeting place that’s familiar and easy to find.

            <b>Step 1: Put a plan together by discussing the questions below with your family, friends, or household to start your emergency plan.</b><br>
            <b>Step 2: Consider specific needs in your household.</b><br>
            <b>As you prepare your plan, tailor your plans and supplies to your specific daily living needs and responsibilities. Discuss your needs and responsibilities and how people in the network can assist each other with communication, care of children, business, pets, or specific needs like operating medical equipment. Create your own personal network for specific areas where you need assistance. Keep in mind some of these factors when developing your plan:</b><br>
            - Different ages of members within your household<br>
            - Responsibilities for assisting others<br>
            - Locations frequented<br>
            - Dietary needs<br>
            - Medical needs, including prescriptions and equipment<br>
            - Disabilities or access and functional needs, including devices and equipment<br>

        <a class="toggle-link" href="#">Built a Kit</a>
        <p class="description"><b>After an emergency, you may need to survive on your own for several days. Being prepared means having your own food, water, and other supplies to last for several days. A disaster supplies kit is a collection of basic items your household may need in the event of an emergency</b>

            <b>Basic Disaster Supplies Kit</b>
            <b>To assemble your kit, store items in airtight plastic bags and put your entire disaster supplies kit in one or two easy-to-carry containers such as plastic bins or a duffel bag. A basic emergency supply kit could include the following recommended items:</b><br>
            - Water (one gallon per person per day for several days, for drinking and sanitation)<br>
            - Food (at least a several-day supply of non-perishable food)<br>
            - Battery-powered or hand-crank radio and a NOAA Weather Radio with tone alert<br>
            - Flashlight<br>
            - First aid kit<br>
            - Moist towelettes, garbage bags, and plastic ties (for personal sanitation)<br>
            - Cell phone with chargers and a backup battery<br>
            
            <b>Additional Emergency Supplies</b>
            <b>Consider adding the following items to your emergency supply kit based on your individual needs:</b>
            - Soap, hand sanitizer, and disinfecting wipes to disinfect surfaces<br>
            - Prescription medications. About half of all Americans take a prescription medicine every day. An emergency can make it difficult for them to refill their prescription or to find an open pharmacy. Organize and protect your prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, and vitamins to prepare for an emergency.<br>
            - Non-prescription medications such as pain relievers, anti-diarrhea medication, antacids, or laxatives<br>
            - Important family documents such as copies of insurance policies, identification, and bank account records saved electronically or in a waterproof, portable container<br>
            - Feminine supplies and personal hygiene items<br>

            <b>Financial Preparedness Tips</b><br>
            <b>Americans at all income levels have experienced the challenges of rebuilding their lives after a disaster or other emergency. In these stressful times, having access to personal financial, insurance, medical and other records is crucial for starting the recovery process quickly and efficiently.</b><br>
            -Gather financial and critical personal, household and medical information.<br>
            -Consider saving money in an emergency savings account that could be used in any crisis. Keep a small amount of cash at home in a safe place. It is important to have small bills on hand because ATMs and credit cards may not work during a disaster when you need to purchase necessary supplies, fuel or food.<br>
            -Obtain property (homeowners or renters), health and life insurance if you do not have them. Not all insurance policies are the same. Review your policy to make sure the amount and types of coverage you have meets the requirements for all possible hazards. Homeowners insurance does not typically cover flooding, so you may need to purchase flood insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program.<br>

        <p class="description"><b>Plan to Evacuate</b><br>
            <b>Many kinds of emergencies can cause you to have to evacuate. In some cases, you may have a day or two to prepare while other situations might call for an immediate evacuation. Planning is vital to making sure that you can evacuate quickly and safely no matter what the circumstances.</b><br>
            <br>
            <b>Before an Evacuation</b><br>
            - Learn the types of disasters that are likely in your community and the local emergency, evacuation and shelter plans for each specific disaster.<br>
            - Plan how you will leave and where you will go if you are advised to evacuate.<br>
            - Check with local officials about what shelter spaces are available for this year.<br>
            - Identify several places you could go in an emergency such as a friend’s home in another town or a motel. Choose destinations in different directions so that you have options during an emergency.<br>
            - If needed, identify a place to stay that will accept pets. Most public shelters allow only service animals.<br>
            - Be familiar with alternate routes and other means of transportation out of your area.<br>
            - Always follow the instructions of local officials and remember that your evacuation route may be on foot depending on the type of disaster.<br>
            - Come up with a family/household plan to stay in touch in case you become separated; have a meeting place and update it depending on the circumstance.<br>
            - Assemble supplies that are ready for evacuation. Prepare a “go-bag” you can carry when you evacuate on foot or public transportation and supplies for traveling longer distances if you have a car.<br>
            - Keep a full tank of gas if an evacuation seems likely. Keep a half tank of gas in it at all times in case of an unexpected need to evacuate. Gas stations may be closed during emergencies and unable to pump gas during power outages. Plan to take one car per family to reduce congestion and delay.<br>

            <b>During an Evacuation</b><br>
            - Follow recommended evacuation routes. Do not take shortcuts, they may be blocked.<br>
            - Be alert for road hazards such as washed-out roads or bridges and downed power lines. Do not drive into flooded areas.<br>
            - Secure your home by closing and locking doors and windows.<br>
            - Unplug electrical equipment such as radios, televisions and small appliances. Leave freezers and refrigerators plugged in unless there is a risk of flooding. If there is damage to your home and you are instructed to do so, shut off water, gas, and electricity before leaving.<br>
            - Leave a note telling others when you left and where you are going.<br>
            - Wear sturdy shoes and clothing that provides some protection such as long pants, long-sleeved shirts, and a hat.<br>
            - Check with neighbors who may need a ride.<br>
            <br>
            <b>After an Evacuation</b><br>
            <b>If you evacuated for the storm, check with local officials both where you’re staying and back home before you travel.</b><br>
            - If you are returning to disaster-affected areas, after significant events prepare for disruptions to daily activities and remember that returning home before storm debris is cleared is dangerous.<br>
            - Let friends and family know before you leave and when you arrive.<br>
            - Charge devices and consider getting back-up batteries in case power outages continue.<br>
            - Fill up your gas tank and consider downloading a fuel app to check for outages along your route.<br>
            - Bring supplies such as water and non-perishable food for the car ride.<br>
            - Avoid downed power or utility lines, they may be live with deadly voltage. Stay away and report them immediately to your power or utility company.<br>
            - Only use generators outside and away from your home and NEVER run a generator inside a home or garage or connect it to your home's electrical system.<br>
